Part I -1
Part II: -3
1. README does not show the video inline: 
2. Directory structure incorrect: should be turtle_control/package.xml and the package contents, not turtle_control/turtle_control/package.xml 
3. workspace files were included in the git repository: 
4. Some topics are absolute  e.g., /turtle1/pose
5. Do not wait for service before creating clients
6. The ROS api for the node is not documented (e.g., services clients etc)
7. Load service does not reset the turtle simulator by calling the reset service.
8. Do not leave extra files that were used for testing or were old versions in the final product (e.g., waypoints2.py) this makes it confusing as to what is current
Othe comments (no points off):
The code in the timer callback  would be greatly simplified if you had used async/await.  But it could also be simplified by adding more states to the state machine: this would help systemize and even eliminate the need for what are essentially implicit states such as the logical combinations of if future == None, self.drawing, and self.skip
